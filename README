## Overview
The goal of this project was to examine fitness tracker data to draw conclusions about the trackers and the physical characteristics and activity of the participants. The datasets were found on kaggle.com (see 'References section'). The Fitbit and Apple Watch dataset was a record of 49 participants by fitness tracker type, heart rate, activity level, etc. over a 65 minute period. The data was collected and stored in .csv files. The data that was only Fitbit data was collected from 30 people over two months and includes a variety of features including, BMI, sleep, calories burned, etc. in the form of .csv files. For this project, we focused on the files that covered participants' heartrate, intensity of activity, amount of sleep, BMI (body mass index), and activity level. 

## The questions that we wanted to answer based on the data that we had available to us were:
1.) How do Apple watches vs. Fitbits compare when taking heart rate data?
2.) How does the activity level correlate to average heart rate?
3.) How does the amount of sleep affect Body Mass Index (BMI)
4.) How does the activity level affect number of calories burned?

## Data Analysis & Conclusions:
### How do Apple watches vs. Fitbits compare when taking heart rate data?
### How does the activity level correlate to average heart rate?
### How does the amount of sleep affect Body Mass Index (BMI)?
### How does the activity level affect number of calories burned?
